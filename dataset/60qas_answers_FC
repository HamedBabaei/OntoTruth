Genera remarks:
- tried to answer with the information contained in ontology only. The issue is when the question is about something that is not said within the ontology, what should be the answer? 
- The categories are weird and debatable. In particular IND should probably not be here. I would suggest to divide the questions in two types: those that can be formulated in DL-queries and those that cannot, then try to see if changing the prompt to make the LLM formulate the DL query against the ontology provides better results for the questions that can be answered that way
- I've ignored the two inconsistent classes
